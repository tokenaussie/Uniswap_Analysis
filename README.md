## Overview and Origin

* Name of company?
Uniswap

* When was the company incorporated? 


* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Uniswap is a protocol for creating liquidity and trading ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.
Uniswap is the beggest single decentralised liquidity source for DEX (Decentralised Exchange) aggregators.
It eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritising decentralisation, censorship resistance, and security.
This allows for fast, efficient trading.

* Who is the company's intended customer?
3 types of users: Liquidity providers, traders, developers.

-Liquidity providers (LP) are incentivized to contribute ERC-20 tokens to common liquidity pools.
    Passive LPs accumulate trading fees
    Professional LPs focus on market making
    Token projects become LPs to create liquidity for their tokens, unlocking interoperability with other DEFI projects through Uniswap
    DEFI pioneers exploring complex liquidity provision interactions like incentivised liquidity, liquidity as collateral

-Traders can swap these tokens for one another for a fixed 0.30% fee (which goes to liquidity providers).
    Speculators swap tokens using liquidity pulled from a Uniswap Protocol
    Arbitrage bots compare prices across different platforms to find an edge
    DAPP (Decentralised applications) users buy tokens on Uniswap for use in other applications on Ethereum
    Smart contracts execute trades on the protocol by implementing swap functionality

-Developers can integrate directly with Uniswap smart contracts to power new and exciting interactions with tokens, trading interfaces, retail experiences, and more.
    UX (User Experience) experiments and front-ends
    Wallets integrate swapping and liquidity provision functionality as a core offering of their product
    DEX (Decentralised exchanges) aggregators pull liquidity from many liquidity protocols to offer traders the best prices
    Smart contract developers invent new DeFi tools and experimental ideas (Unisocks, Zora etc)

In total, interactions between these classes create a positive feedback loop, fueling digital economies by defining a common language through which tokens can be pooled, traded and used.

* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
As of 16/02/2021, total liquidity on Uniswap is $4.4B USD

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol powered by a constant product formula and implemented in a system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
For token projects which are not listed on major exchanges (eg Binance), Uniswap is a way for them to create liquidity for their tokens.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Automated liquidity protocol.
Ethereum blockchain.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, decentralised finance

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Moving from centralised finance to crypotocurrencies.
A subset of cryptocurrencies is defi aka decentralised finance.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
